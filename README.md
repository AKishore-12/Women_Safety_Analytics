# Women_Safety_Analytics
# Abstract/Summary:
The Women Safety Analytics system aims to enhance public safety through real-time surveillance and AI-powered analytics. By utilizing cutting-edge technologies like YOLOv5 for object detection, VGG16 for gender classification, and LSTM and Mediapipe for gesture and posture analysis, the system proactively detects potential threats to women’s safety. It identifies situations such as a lone woman at night or a woman surrounded by men, and recognizes distress gestures to trigger alerts. Integrated with the ICCC (Integrated Command and Control Center), the system ensures timely intervention by authorities, helping prevent incidents before they escalate. The project leverages existing surveillance infrastructure like CCTV, making it scalable and adaptable for urban environments, contributing to a safer community.

# Idea Description
The Women Safety Analytics solution is designed to address the growing concerns regarding women’s safety in public spaces. It combines real-time monitoring and advanced AI-based anomaly detection to protect women from potential threats. The system continuously analyzes video feeds to:

Detect individuals and classify their gender.
Identify anomalous situations, such as a lone woman in a high-risk area or a woman surrounded by men.
Recognize distress gestures and dangerous postures using gesture and posture detection technologies.
The solution is powered by YOLOv5, VGG16, LSTM, and Mediapipe for precise detection and analysis. High-risk areas are identified through hotspot analysis, allowing for focused safety measures. Integrated with the ICCC, it facilitates rapid alert transmission to designated personnel, ensuring quick intervention. This solution creates a safer environment, reduces crime rates, and builds community trust by empowering law enforcement with actionable insights.
